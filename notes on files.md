The `old/` folder and its files are from a previous version of the analysis before we added additional data.

R scripts:
`analysis clean.R` - contains both the cleaning script on the most recent data, and the preliminary data analysis with outputs
`data processing script.R` - contains an older version of the scripted cleanings of the XLSX data

Figures:
`analysis_scatterplot_new.png` - this is generated by the R code
`analysisplot_new.png` - this is generated by the R code
`boxplot_figure.png` - generated by the R code

Note there's a `for manuscript/` folder, which SEEMS to have identical copies of the figures here.

Data files:
`data New 102113.xlsx` - no idea what this is, looks like a very old version of the data from the date
`Data_Final_092315 BAB.xlsx` - this looks like the last version of the data used in the analysis
`Data_Final_092315.xlsx` - appears to be a slightly older version of the data
`Data_Final_092315 copy.xlsx` - appears identical to `Data_Final_092315.xlsx`, redundant
`data_clean.RData` - an R binary file, containing a processed version of the data output by the analysis script
